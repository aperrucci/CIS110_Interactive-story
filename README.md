# Interactive-story
this is a bit of code that I wrote for an introduction to python class.  It is an interactive story that will allow the user to choose different scenarios to create a different story each time they play.
This story is about a cat that lives at home and comes across an open door and there starts the first decision.  Go outside and explore or stay instide and sleep.
